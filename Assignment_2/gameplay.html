        <h1>How to play marksmen</h1>
        <p>At the beginning of the game as marksman you need to prioritize farming. Basically, you need to try and last
            hit as many minions as possible. If your last hitting is bad you need to practice it vs bots or on custom
            empty map because it is one of the most fundamental and important things in the game. Depending on your
            support the lanes are as follows – all in, disengage, passive, aggressive. All in is when you can dive the
            enemy under turret or go straight into them and eliminate them. Disengage is when you can negate all of the
            enemy’s abilities. Passive is just scaling for late game, so just farming, Aggressive is trying to harass
            the enemy as much as possible while farming. All of these depend on how strong your marksmen is and what
            kind of support you have. You should always pay attention to where your jungler is on the map, so if they
            need help or if they are going to gank you, you can react. You also need to pay attention to the enemy
            jungler, so you don’t get surprise gank. Also, buy wards to get vision, so you could avoid that. Watch the
            minimap at all times if there is any objectives available or if your team needs help, where the enemy is
            etc. The minimap could give you a lot of useful information. In mid game, that’s around 20 min mark, you
            should be trying to push the lanes, get objectives and help your team in team fights. However, you should be
            trying to farm as much as possible the whole game because it’s very important for marksman to scale fast.
            Late game is pretty much like mid game but you will have less room for mistakes and there will be a lot of
            team fights. Do not rush games but do not stall them either. If you rush games and you make a mistake you
            might end up giving the enemy their advantage or come back. Same if you stall games. In team fights the
            positioning of marksman is extremely important because you are the main damage dealer, so if the enemy team
            eliminates you, your team might lose the fight. A good practice is to be aware of the enemies abilities and
            cooldowns at all times. As well as where they are. Marksman are usually very fragile that is why you need to
            be very careful. Basically try to do as much damage as possible while staying safe. Everything else like
            decision making etc. come with practice and experience.</p>
