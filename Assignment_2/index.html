        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>Hello, my real name is Ivan but online I am known as The Copy Cat. I mainly play a very popular game called
            League of Legends. I have been playing this game for 10 seasons so far which is equal to 10 years. I am
            decent at the game. I mainly play marksman aka ADC. I can play any other role at pretty good level. I have
            good understanding of the game in general. On this website I will try to teach people how to play marksman
            mainly. I have read a lot of forums and I hear a lot of people complaining that they cannot rank up in the
            game, so I am going to cover all the basics and everything you need to know.</p>
