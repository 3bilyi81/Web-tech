        <p>1.How long do I need to play Leauge of Legends for to get a high rank?
            There is no specific time lenght you should play the game for. Everyone improves at different rate. However,
            I would suggest to play at least 4-5 games a day or minimum of 3 games a day.
        </p>
        <p>2.Do champion skins give me any advantage?
            Usually skins don't give you any advantage but with some skins your champion might appear different or
            smaller, so that might confuse the enemy. Also, different skins have different animations, so it might be
            difficult for you to learn animation cancel if you constantly play with different skins.
        </p>
        <p>3.Do I need good mechanical play to get to a higher rank?
            Not necessarily. At high level you do need some decent mechanics but that also depends on the champion you
            play. You can play simple champions and climb without really good mechanics. What's most important is your
            knowledge of the game. That will help you climb the ladder.
        </p>
        <p>4.Is it easier to climb the ladder with some roles compared to others?
            Yes and no. Some roles have more impact on the game but it all depends on what your strenghts and weaknesses
            are. Every role is different, so if you do not understand a role you will not climb even if it's the most
            impractful one. On this website I've only covered marksman which is the most difficult one to climb with.
