        <h1>Jinx</h1>
        <img class="image" src="images/JinxSquare.png" alt="Jinx">
        <p>Jinx is a pretty good marksman overall. She has average mobility, AOE damage, good scaling and it is pretty
            simple and easy to play. She usually does not get any serious buffs or nerfs, so she is playable every
            season. With her the most imortant thing is farming and scaling. Her early game is not as strong but her
            late game is really strong. Try to poke enemies as much as you can while farming but don't engage in any
            series fights because most of the other marksman are stronger earlier than Jinx. The only exception is if
            the enemy is outnumbered by your team or you have some sort of advantage like more health, you are ahead of
            them etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="champion2">
        <h1>Ezreal</h1>
        <img class="image" src="images/PulsefireEzrealSquare.png" alt="Ezreal">
        <p>Ezreal is pretty safe marksman. He does not get huge nerfs or buffs either but he is not always playable
            because sometimes other marksman get huge buffs and he can't keep up with that. He is very mobile, so the
            positioning should be easy. With him you want to focus on farming and scaling just like with Jinx. Try to
            poke enemies with your first ability but like with Jinx don't engage in any series fight early. Try to push
            the waves and go back to buy items as often as you can since Ezreal unlike Jinx requires items that scale
            with time, so the earlier you buy them the faster they will scale.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="champion3">
        <h1>Tristana</h1>
        <img class="image" src="images/TristanaSquare.png" alt="Tristana">
        <p>Tristana is another good beginner marksman. She has decent mobility. Okay AOE damage. She is also a playable
            marksman every season. With her you can all in in fights early and late. You still have to scale that
            applies to all marksman. She is very aggressive marksman, so if you keep track of your enemies abilities and
            cooldowns you can easily all in them and get an objective.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="champion4">
        <h1>jhin</h1>
        <img class="image" src="images/JhinSquare.png" alt="Jhin">
        <p>Jhin is a bit different since all other marksman have really good attack speed but he does not. He is mainly
            damaged focused marksman, so you have to be careful how you use your abilities and attacks. He is very
            immobile, so you have to be really careful when it comes to positioning. He is strong early game and late
            game. He is more team based as in you have to rely on your team to set up the fights for you but if they do
            it he is really good. He is also very useful to the team because of his abilites. He is a bit tanky compared
            to other marksman.</p>
